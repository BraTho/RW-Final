        <h1>Facts/information</h1>
        <h3>Climate</h3>
        <p>Egypt’s climate is dry, hot, and dominated by desert. It has a mild winter season with rain falling along coastal areas, and a hot and dry summer season (May to September). Daytime temperatures vary by season and change with the prevailing winds. In the coastal regions, temperatures range between average winter minimums of 14°C (November to April) and average summer maximums of 30°C (May to October). Temperatures vary widely in the inland desert areas, especially during the summer, where they range from 7°C at night to 43°C during the day. During winter, temperatures in the desert fluctuate less dramatically, but can reach 0°C at night and as high as 18°C during the day. Egypt also experiences hot wind storms, known as “khamsin”, which carry sand and dust and sweep across the northern coast of Africa. These khamsin storms typically occur between March and May and can increase the temperature by 20°C in two hours; and can last for several days</p>

        <h3>Time and Holidays</h3>
        <p>Egypts time zone is Eastern European Standard Time. Public holidays are celebrated by the entire population of Egypt. Holidays in Egypt have many classifications. Some holidays are religious and others are secular, while some can be fixed holidays on the calendar while others are movable. There are four Islamic holidays and two Christian holidays. The National Day of Egypt is celebrated on July, 23[1] which coincides with the annual celebration of the Egyptian revolution of 1952 when the modern republic of Egypt was declared, ending the period of the Kingdom of Egypt.</p>

        <h3>Economy</h3>
        <p>The economy of Egypt used to be a highly centralized economy, focused on import substitution under president Gamal Abdel Nasser (1954–1970). During the rule of president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi (2014–present), the economy follows Egypt's 2030 Vision. The policy is aimed at diversifying Egypt's economy. The country's economy is the largest in Africa by nominal GDP, and 38th in worldwide ranking as of 2023.[20]
            Since the 2000s, the pace of structural reforms (including fiscal and monetary policies, taxation, privatization and new business legislation) helped Egypt move towards a more market-oriented economy and prompted increased foreign investment. The reforms and policies have strengthened macroeconomic annual growth results. As Egypt's economy healed, other prominent issues like unemployment and poverty began to decline significantly.[21][22] The country benefits from political stability; its proximity to Europe, and increased exports. From an investor perspective, Egypt is stable and well-supported by external stakeholders.[23]</p>

        <h3>WildLife</h3>
        <p>The wildlife of Egypt is composed of the flora and fauna of this country in northeastern Africa and southwestern Asia, and is substantial and varied. Apart from the fertile Nile Valley, which bisects the country from south to north, the majority of Egypt's landscape is desert, with a few scattered oases. It has long coastlines on the Mediterranean Sea, the Gulf of Suez, the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea. Each geographic region has a diversity of plants and animals each adapted to its own particular habitat.</p>

        <h3>Lotus</h3>
        <p>The lotus flower played a very important role in the life and preparations for the after-life of the Ancient Egyptian people. It is believed that in many tomb paintings, the deceased is painted holding or smelling a lotus flower. It was believed that a lotus blossom, because of its intense fragrance, would help restore the senses of the deceased person once they reached the after-life. In this painting we also see that she has an offering table with containers of wine and food. This would have been to sustain her in the after-life and also to offer an offering to whichever god she may encounter that required an offering in the after-life.</p>

    <div class="dbg col-sm-12 col-md-2 col-lg-2 float-start">
        <h3>Agriculture</h3>
        <p>The Nile Valley and Delta are the country’s two most agriculturally productive lands, which covers an estimated 6 million acres when combined. Grains (rice, wheat, and corn), cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, and onions are the most important crops in Egypt. Most of Egypt sits on a desert, which expands each year, threatening the country’s 3.1 million-hectare arable land. An estimated 11,736 hectares of this agricultural land is lost to desertification each year. As water is a scarce resource in the country, Egypt has invested heavily in solar-powered desalination facilities. The country relies on food imports to sustain its domestic demand. The domestic production of wheat in the country was about 8.3 million tons in 2015, against a demand of 19.6 million tons. In the same period, the country produced 6.1 million tons of corn, against a demand of 10.9 million tons. Most of the imported grain is sourced from the United States.</p>

        <h3>Ethnic and religious Groups</h3>
        <p>Religion in Egypt controls many aspects of social life and is endorsed by law. The state religion of Egypt is Islam, although estimates vary greatly in the absence of official statistics. Since the 2006 census religion has been excluded, and thus available statistics are estimates made by religious and non-governmental agencies. The country is majority Sunni Muslim (estimated to be 85-95% of the population), with the next largest religious group being Coptic Orthodox Christians (with estimates ranging from 5-15%[note 1]). The exact numbers are subject to controversy, with Christians alleging that they have been systemically under-counted in existing censuses</p>
